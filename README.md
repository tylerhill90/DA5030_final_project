# Nvidia stock price time series analysis

The reports directory contains the rendered html reports as well as the Rmarkdown and Jupyter notebooks for this project.

The [nvda_analysis.html](./reports/nvda_analysis.html) file contains the main report.

The function that gathers the data for this project was developed in [wrangle.html](./reports/wrangle.html).

There are two other reports besides the main analysis where I build models in python. They are the [knn_ts.html](./reports/knn_ts.html) report and the [lstm_rnn.html](./reports/lstm_rnn.html) report.
